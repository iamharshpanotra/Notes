ðŸ”· What is an Array?
An array in C++ is a data structure that holds a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays are used when you want to store multiple values of the same type together under a single variable name and access them using an index.

ðŸ”· Why Use Arrays?
Without arrays, you would have to declare individual variables for each value, like this:
int mark1, mark2, mark3, mark4, mark5;
Using an array:
int marks[5]; // Stores 5 integers in one go
Arrays make your code cleaner, shorter, and more efficient, especially when working with loops and large datasets.

ðŸ”· Declaring and Initializing Arrays
âœ… Declaration Syntax
datatype arrayName[size];
âœ… Example:
int numbers[5];
This creates an array that can store 5 integers.
âœ… Initialization:
int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
Or:
int numbers[] = {10, 20, 30}; // Size is inferred as 3
You can also assign values later:
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;

ðŸ”· Accessing Array Elements
Array elements are accessed using zero-based indexing.
cout << numbers[0]; // Outputs 10
cout << numbers[1]; // Outputs 20
You can also use loops for easier processing:
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    cout << numbers[i] << " ";
}

ðŸ”· Memory Representation
Arrays in C++ are stored in contiguous memory locations. For example, for an int numbers[3], the memory layout may look like this:
Index	Address	Value
0	0x100	10
1	0x104	20
2	0x108	30
Each int occupies 4 bytes (may vary depending on system).
This allows constant time access: numbers[i] = Base address + (i * size_of_element)

ðŸ”· Types of Arrays
1. Single-Dimensional Array
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
A simple list of values.
2. Multidimensional Array
Used to store tables or matrices.
int matrix[2][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6}
};
Accessing: matrix[1][2] â†’ 6
3. Character Array (Strings)
char name[6] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
Or simply:
char name[] = "Hello";
C++ treats this as a C-style string.

ðŸ”· Limitations of Arrays
    â€¢ Fixed Size: You must know the size at compile time.
    â€¢ No Built-in Bounds Checking: Accessing arr[10] in a size 5 array leads to undefined behavior.
    â€¢ Not Resizable: Unlike std::vector, arrays can't grow/shrink dynamically.

ðŸ”· C++ Alternatives to Arrays
For more flexibility and safety, C++ offers alternatives:
ðŸ”¹ std::vector
Dynamic array-like container from the Standard Template Library (STL):
#include <vector>
vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
nums.push_back(5); // Adds 5 to the end
ðŸ”¹ std::array
Safer and more modern replacement for C-style arrays (since C++11):
#include <array>
array<int, 5> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

ðŸ”· Real-Life Use Cases of Arrays
    â€¢ Storing scores, prices, names, sensor readings
    â€¢ Implementing data structures (stacks, queues, matrices)
    â€¢ Handling large datasets in games, simulations, or embedded systems

ðŸ”· Example Program
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int marks[5];
cout << "Enter 5 marks:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cin >> marks[i];
    }
cout << "You entered:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "Mark " << (i+1) << ": " << marks[i] << endl;
    }
return 0;
}
